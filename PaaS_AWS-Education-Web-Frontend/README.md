## Quick Start

### Development Environment

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+ (v22 recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Docker (for containerization)

#### Setup Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # If .env.example exists, otherwise create manually
```

2. Configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```
VITE_AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1
VITE_AWS_USER_POOL_ID=your-user-pool-id
VITE_AWS_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=your-user-pool-client-id
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### Running the Application Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

The application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Docker Deployment

```

2. Run the build script to create a Docker image:

```bash
./buildimage.sh
```

3. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name educonnect-app educonnect-app
```

### Checking if the Container is Running

## Troubleshooting

### Common Docker Issues

1. **Environment Variables Missing**: Make sure all required environment variables are passed to the Docker build.

2. **Nginx Configuration**: If the application shows a default Nginx page instead of the React app, check that:
   - The `nginx.conf` file exists in your project root
   - The build process completed successfully
   - The Dockerfile correctly copies files from the build stage

3. **Docker Build Errors**: Common issues include:
   - Missing `.env` file or nginx.conf - fixed by the approach in the Dockerfile
   - Network timeouts during npm install - try again or use a different network
   - Insufficient memory during build - increase Docker's resource allocation

4. **AWS Cognito Connection Issues**: Check if the correct AWS region and pool IDs are configured.
